<h1>The Best Movies According to Guuh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Barnyard:</h3>
<p>Barnyard was a movie I watched a lot in my childhood with my younger brother and my mother. It stands as my first movie, at the time for being one of my first consumed animations, followed by avatar aang and others, but also for the feeling that there is.</p>

<h3>Joker:</h3>
<p>Joker was a worthy social criticism, I as a person of low class and carrier of a genetic disease, I have always been indignant with the lack of empathy, the film portrays not only that, but also a series of problems and hypocrisy that society employs.</p>

<h3>The Intouchables:</h3>
<p>Intouchables shows a relationship between two people from different realities getting along very well and teaching each other lessons. It also teaches the value of needs other than money.</p>
